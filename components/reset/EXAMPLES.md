## Introduction

Defining new CSS base elements is beneficial to ensure predictability and consistency in the way browsers render your components.

This `Reset` component is used to define new CSS base elements on a `component level` instead of a global level.

This is very useful for use-cases like widgets or other stand-alone components where you have no control over it's `runtime`.

It's important to understand that this `Reset` component will only apply new base styles to its child components.

Additionally, you can fully isolate the component with setting the `isImportant` attribute.

If you actually have control over your project global styles, it's probably a better idea clean the base styles on a global level instead.

## Default usage

By default, it will apply the __Eric Meyer's__ CSS reset.

```html
<Reset>This component has a Eric Meyer's CSS reset applied</Reset>
```

## Isolate your component

By setting `isImportant` you enable all CSS reset values to be `!important`. This avoids having any global element styles `leaking` from their parent elements and will fully isolate your component.

```html
<Reset isImportant>This box has all reset values set to `!important`</Reset>
```

## Alternative resets

You can also use `normalize`, which is another popular CSS reset package.

```html
<Reset use="normalize">This component has Nicolas Gallagher Normalize.css applied</Reset>
```

You can use various popular CSS reset base styles. The following CSS reset base styles are available:

## Use your own CSS reset

Alternatively you can also use your own custom CSS reset.

## Arguments

## Why not just use all unset?

Using `all: unset` revert all the styling to its initial value or inherent value, and both of these values can render a component different depending on the browsers.
