## Introduction

**Cleaning your CSS base elements is beneficial to ensure predictability and consistency in the way browsers render your components.**

With this small [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) component you can define new CSS base elements on a `component scope`, where a traditional the base elements should be cleaned on a `global scope`. However cleaning these base styles on a `component scope` is useful for stand-alone components, such as widgets, or other scenarios where you don't have full control over its environment.

It's important to note that this component will only apply styles to itself and its child components.

Additionally, you can isolate fully isolate your component by [passing the `isImportant` attribute](#-isolate-your-component).

Keep in mind; if you actually have control over your projects global styles, it's probably a better idea clean the base styles on a `global scope` instead. Here's a list of the most popular global [CSS base element cleaners](#-global-base-style-cleaners) available.

## Default usage

By default, it will apply the __Eric Meyer's__ CSS reset.

```html
<Reset>This component has a Eric Meyer's CSS reset applied</Reset>
```

## Arguments

{{ arguments }}

## Isolate your component

By setting `isImportant` you enable all CSS reset values to be `!important` inside the `component scope`. This avoids having any global element styles `leaking` from their parent elements and makes it possible to fully isolates your component and its children.

```html
<Reset isImportant>This box has all reset values set to `!important`</Reset>
```

## Alternative resets

You can also use `normalize`, which is another popular CSS reset package.

```html
<Reset use="normalize">This component has Nicolas Gallagher Normalize.css applied</Reset>
```

You can use various popular CSS reset base styles. The following CSS reset base styles are available:

## Use your own CSS reset

Alternatively you can also use your own custom CSS reset. (write more here)

## Why not just use all unset?

Using `all: unset` revert all the styling to its initial value or inherent value, and both of these values can render a component different depending on the browsers.

## Global base style cleaners

These CSS resets might be implemented in the future to use with this `Reset` component.
